How to use application

When you start the application and register, your user account will have role "user" by default and you will not be able to see admin panel.

To make yourself admin, you first need to find your user ID. Open mongo shell and type:

db.users.find().pretty()
Copy your user id and then type:

db.users.update({ _id: "YOUR_USER_ID" }, { $set: { roles: ["admin"] } })
Now, you have admin panel in your application and you can manage users.

This example has three user roles:

user can login but cannot access admin panel

admin can access admin panel

blocked user is blocked and cannot login
